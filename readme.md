# How To Set up Wiki Pathfinding App

## Getting the files and code
- Start by going in the master branch and unzip article.zip into same folder as executable. Unzip article.zip in Wiki_Pathfinding/backend 
- Then move over to the create-react-app branch and clone it in Visual Studio Code
- The create-react-app branch contains the Vite and Nodejs server directories while the master contains the c++ source files

## istalling Nodejs and npm
- Start by checking out the nodejs download website to download nodejs and npm. https://nodejs.org/en/download
- Open the terminal into the Wiki_Pathfinding folder you cloned and then cd into the backend folder like this: "cd .\wiki_pathfinding_app\"
- Then run "npm install"

### Running it
- The project can be ran by going to the wiki_pathfinding_app with "cd wiki_pathfinding_app"
- Then run "npm run start:dev"
- This will load the project in and you should see the project running at http://localhost:5173/
- Keep in mind that the search and random buttons wont work until all the files are loaded in, which takes around 20 seconds after starting up the server.
